If you have worked with WooCommerce variable products and product attributes, you've already know how to use this plugin. 

When creating new product attribute, you choose type "Image". Then, you upload any image to represent that attribute (for examples: color, size...). Bumm, it's ready to work. 

It saves you $99 as the same add-on from official WooCommerce has that price.
